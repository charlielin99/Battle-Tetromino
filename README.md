# Battle-Tetromino
Battle Tetromino is a variation of the classic game Tetris, where players can play by themselves, against a machine algorithm, or against another player. Players can set Tetromino-shaped obstacles on their opponent's playing field (hence the game name) and either boost themselves or interfere their opponent's gameplay during a set period. The game is Tetris with a creative twist; armed with creative and fun features!
